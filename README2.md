# README.md assignment

This is a little non-pretentious project to learn how to make README.md files and simultaneously as an assignment for the Full-Stack Software Developer lesson about README.md files.

## 02-12-2024: first contribute

This project is at this point only built with HTML. I've used two headers (h1 and h2), paragraphs and line-breaks.
In the following days I'll be returning to this project and try to implement more complex HTML elements and some CSS styling, so stay tuned for that!
